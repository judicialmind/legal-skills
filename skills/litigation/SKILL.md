## Key Deadlines (Federal)

| Event | Rule | Deadline |
|-------|------|----------|
| Answer to Complaint | FRCP 12(a) | 21 days (60 if waiver) |
| Motion to Dismiss | FRCP 12(b) | Before responsive pleading |
| Initial Disclosures | FRCP 26(a)(1) | 14 days after 26(f) conf |
| Discovery Cutoff | Local Rule | Per scheduling order |
| Expert Disclosures | FRCP 26(a)(2) | Per scheduling order |
| Summary Judgment | FRCP 56 | Per scheduling order |
| Pretrial Motions | Local Rule | Per scheduling order |

## Motion Practice

### Motion to Dismiss (Rule 12(b))

**Grounds**:
1. Lack of subject matter jurisdiction (12(b)(1))
2. Lack of personal jurisdiction (12(b)(2))
3. Improper venue (12(b)(3))
4. Insufficient process (12(b)(4))
5. Insufficient service (12(b)(5))
6. **Failure to state a claim (12(b)(6))** - most common
7. Failure to join necessary party (12(b)(7))

**12(b)(6) Standard** (Twombly/Iqbal):
- Must state a claim that is "plausible on its face"
- Factual allegations must raise right to relief "above speculative level"
- Court accepts well-pleaded facts as true
- Legal conclusions are not entitled to presumption of truth

### Motion for Summary Judgment (Rule 56)

**Standard**: No genuine dispute of material fact; movant entitled to judgment as a matter of law

**Framework**:
```
1. Identify elements of claim/defense
2. For each element:
   - Cite undisputed facts (with record citations)
   - Explain why no genuine dispute exists
   - Apply law to facts
3. Address opponent's evidence
   - Show it's inadmissible, irrelevant, or insufficient
4. Conclude entitlement to judgment
```

**Response Strategy**:
- Cite specific facts showing genuine dispute
- Provide record citations for every disputed fact
- Argue reasonable inferences in non-movant's favor
- Consider Rule 56(d) continuance if discovery incomplete

## Discovery

### Written Discovery

| Type | Rule | Purpose | Limits (Federal) |
|------|------|---------|------------------|
| Interrogatories | 33 | Factual questions | 25 (including subparts) |
| RFPs | 34 | Documents/ESI | No numeric limit |
| RFAs | 36 | Admit facts | No numeric limit |

### Deposition Practice

**Preparation Checklist**:
- [ ] Review all documents produced by/about witness
- [ ] Outline topics by subject matter
- [ ] Prepare exhibits and marking strategy
- [ ] Know the rules (7-hour limit, objection grounds)
- [ ] Coordinate with co-counsel on areas

**Objection Grounds** (FRCP 30(c)(2)):
- Form of question (leading, compound, vague)
- Privilege
- Outside scope (for 30(b)(6))
- Harassment

### Privilege Review

**Attorney-Client Privilege Elements**:
1. Communication
2. Between attorney and client
3. Made in confidence
4. For purpose of legal advice

**Work Product Doctrine**:
- Prepared in anticipation of litigation
- Opinion work product (mental impressions) vs. ordinary work product
- Can be overcome by substantial need/undue hardship (ordinary only)

## Key Standards of Review

| Motion Type | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| 12(b)(1) | De novo (facial); preponderance (factual) |
| 12(b)(6) | De novo (accepting facts as true) |
| Summary Judgment | De novo (viewing facts in light most favorable to non-movant) |
| Discovery | Abuse of discretion |
| Preliminary Injunction | Abuse of discretion |

## Preliminary Injunction Factors

**Federal Standard** (Winter v. NRDC):
1. Likelihood of success on the merits
2. Likelihood of irreparable harm absent injunction
3. Balance of hardships favors movant
4. Injunction is in public interest
