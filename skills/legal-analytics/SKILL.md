### Expected Value Calculation
```
Expected Value = Σ (Probability × Outcome Value)

Example:
- Win probability: 60%
- Win value: $500,000
- Lose probability: 40%
- Lose value: -$200,000 (costs + adverse judgment)

Expected Value = (0.60 × $500,000) + (0.40 × -$200,000)
               = $300,000 - $80,000
               = $220,000
```

### Decision Tree Analysis
```
                    ┌── Win (60%) ──── $500,000
         ┌── Trial ─┤
         │          └── Lose (40%) ──── -$200,000
Case ────┤
         │          ┌── Accept (100%) ── $150,000
         └── Settle ─┤
                    └── Reject ──── [Return to Trial]

Trial EV: $220,000
Settlement: $150,000 (certain)
Decision: Go to trial (higher EV) OR Settle (risk-averse)
```

Expected Recovery: $500,000
Litigation Costs: $200,000
ROI: ($500,000 - $200,000) / $200,000 = 150%

Settlement Comparison:
Settlement Offer: $250,000
Settlement Costs: $50,000
Settlement Net: $200,000

Trial Expected Value:
Expected Recovery: $300,000 (probability-adjusted)
